# AI Workflow Interface

A conversational data integration platform where users describe data pipelines and see them visualized as interactive flow diagrams. Built for the Nexla Take-Home Assignment.

## üöÄ Live Demo

- **Frontend**: [https://cute-meringue-5c8765.netlify.app](https://cute-meringue-5c8765.netlify.app)
- **Backend API**: [https://ai-workflow-interface-production.up.railway.app](https://ai-workflow-interface-production.up.railway.app)
- **WebSocket**: `wss://ai-workflow-interface-production.up.railway.app`

## üéØ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a modern frontend application with a Node.js backend that uses AI to help users create data flows through natural language conversations. Users can describe data pipelines like "Connect Shopify to Snowflake" and the AI will guide them through the setup process with clarifying questions and visual flow diagrams.

## üéØ Demo Guide - What to Expect

### üöÄ Quick Start Demo

**Step 1: Visit the App**

- Go to [https://cute-meringue-5c8765.netlify.app](https://cute-meringue-5c8765.netlify.app)
- You'll see a clean landing page with an input field

**Step 2: Start Your First Workflow**

- **Option A - Try Examples**: Click on any example card (Shopify to Snowflake, Salesforce to Mailchimp, etc.)
- **Option B - Custom Workflow**: Type your own description like `"Connect my database to Google Analytics"`
- Click "Start Workflow" or press Enter
- Watch the AI begin processing your request

**Step 3: Experience the AI Conversation**

- The AI will ask clarifying questions like:
  - "What type of Shopify data do you want to sync?"
  - "Do you have your Snowflake credentials ready?"
  - "What's your preferred sync frequency?"
- Answer these questions naturally

**Step 4: Watch the Visual Flow Build**

- As you provide information, you'll see:
  - A visual workflow diagram appear on the right
  - Nodes representing your data sources and destinations
  - Connections showing data flow between components
  - Status indicators (pending ‚Üí partial ‚Üí complete)

**Step 5: Complete the Configuration**

- The AI will guide you through each step
- You'll see real-time updates to the workflow
- The diagram will show completion status for each component

### üí° Best Demo Examples

1. **Shopify to Snowflake** (Click the example card)
   - Shows e-commerce data pipeline
   - AI asks about product data, orders, customers
   - Visual flow builds as you answer

2. **Salesforce to Mailchimp** (Click the example card)
   - Demonstrates CRM to email marketing integration
   - AI guides through contact data and sync settings
   - Shows lead nurturing workflows

3. **HubSpot to Analytics** (Click the example card)
   - Marketing analytics integration

   - Professional marketing workflow

4. **Stripe to BigQuery** (Click the example card)
   - Payment data to data warehouse
   - AI guides through transaction data and reporting
   - Financial analytics workflow

### üé® What You'll See

**Real-time AI Processing:**

- Live typing indicators
- AI "thinking" messages
- Progressive workflow building

**Interactive Visual Elements:**

- Drag-and-drop ready workflow canvas
- Color-coded nodes (blue=source, purple=transform, green=destination)
- Status indicators with animations
- Clickable nodes for detailed configuration

**Professional UI:**

### üí¨ Pro Tips for Demo

- **Try the Examples**: Click on example cards for instant, predictable workflows
- **Be Specific**: "Connect Shopify to Snowflake" works better than "set up a data pipeline"
- **Answer Questions**: The AI will ask for details - provide them for a complete workflow
- **Watch the Flow**: The visual diagram updates in real-time as you interact
- **Try Different Scenarios**: Each example shows different AI capabilities
- **Explore the Interface**: Click on nodes to see detailed configuration panels

### üîß Implementation Approach

**Current Demo Implementation:**

- **Client-side Template Conversion**: URL parameters like `/workflow/shopify-snowflake` are converted to natural language messages
- **No Server Changes**: Uses existing AI conversation flow without backend modifications
- **Quick Prototype**: Implemented for demo purposes to save development time

**Ideal Production Approach:**

- **Server-side Templates**: Pre-built workflow templates stored on the server
- **Template IDs**: `/workflow/shopify-snowflake` would load a predefined template
- **Reduced AI Costs**: Examples wouldn't consume AI tokens
- **Consistent Experience**: Same workflow structure every time
- **Better Performance**: Instant template loading vs AI processing
- **Professional UX**: Like real SaaS products with predefined integrations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + React Flow + Zustand
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express + WebSocket
- **AI**: Groq Cloud (Llama3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, Llama3-8B) with automatic fallback
- **Real-time**: WebSocket for live chat interface
- **State Management**: Zustand for client-side state
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with HubSpot-inspired orange theme

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to server directory**:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment**:

   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env and add your Groq API key (get from https://console.groq.com/)
   ```

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The server will run on `http://localhost:3001`

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to client directory**:

   ```bash

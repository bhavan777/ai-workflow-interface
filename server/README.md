# AI Workflow Interface Server

A Node.js server that provides AI-powered data pipeline configuration through conversational interfaces.

## 🚀 Live Demo

**Backend API**: [https://ai-workflow-interface-production.up.railway.app](https://ai-workflow-interface-production.up.railway.app)  
**WebSocket**: `wss://ai-workflow-interface-production.up.railway.app`

## 🎯 What This Server Does

### 🤖 AI-Powered Conversations
- **Groq Cloud Integration**: Uses Llama3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3-8B models
- **Automatic Model Fallback**: If one model fails, automatically tries the next
- **Intelligent Responses**: Generates contextual, helpful responses to user queries
- **Workflow Building**: Creates visual data flow diagrams from natural language

### 🔄 Real-time Communication
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time bidirectional communication with clients
- **Live Status Updates**: Sends processing status and progress indicators
- **Instant Responses**: Sub-second response times for most queries
- **Connection Management**: Handles multiple concurrent connections

### 📊 Workflow Management
- **Visual Flow Generation**: Creates interactive workflow diagrams
- **Node Configuration**: Manages source, transform, and destination nodes
- **Status Tracking**: Tracks completion status for each workflow component
- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across multiple messages

## Core Behavior

### 1. Conversation Management

- **Stores conversations** in JSON files (development) or in-memory (production)
- **Clears conversations** on server startup for a clean slate
- **Maintains conversation history** to avoid asking the same questions twice
- **Handles conversation persistence** with automatic fallback to in-memory storage

### 2. AI-Powered Workflow Configuration

- **Creates rigid 3-node workflows**: Source → Transform → Destination
- **Asks predefined questions** in a fixed order for each node
- **Accepts any user input** without validation (assumes all input is correct)
- **Maintains workflow state** across conversation turns
- **Completes nodes sequentially** before moving to the next

### 3. Rigid Question Script

The AI follows a **fixed script** for every workflow:

#### Source Node (3 questions, always in this order):

1. "What's your source account name or service identifier? For example: mycompany or myaccount"
2. "What's your source username or access key? For example: user@company.com or access_key_123"
3. "What's your source password or secret key? For example: mypassword123 or sk_live_1234567890abcdef"

#### Transform Node (3 questions, always in this order):

1. "What type of data transformation do you need? For example: filter, aggregate, or map"
2. "What are the transformation parameters? For example: field_name, condition, or mapping_rules"
3. "What is the output format? For example: json, csv, or structured_data"

#### Destination Node (3 questions, always in this order):

1. "What's your destination account name or service identifier? For example: mywarehouse or mydatabase"
2. "What's your destination username or access key? For example: admin@company.com or db_user"
3. "What's your destination password or connection string? For example: mypassword123 or postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db"

### 4. Node Configuration Structure

Each node has a **fixed structure**:

```json
{
  "id": "source-node|transform-node|destination-node",
  "type": "source|transform|destination",
  "name": "Data Source|Data Transform|Data Destination",
  "status": "pending|partial|complete",
  "config": {},
  "data_requirements": {
    "required_fields": ["field1", "field2", "field3"],
    "provided_fields": [],
    "missing_fields": ["field1", "field2", "field3"]
  }
}
```

## Key Requirements

### 1. Rigid Configuration

- ✅ **Fixed node structure** - Never changes based on user input
- ✅ **Fixed question script** - Same questions for every workflow
- ✅ **Fixed field requirements** - Same fields for each node type
- ✅ **No dynamic customization** - AI doesn't adapt questions to specific services

### 2. No Validation

- ✅ **Accepts all input** - Never rejects or questions user input
- ✅ **No format checking** - Doesn't validate URLs, API keys, etc.
- ✅ **No real-world verification** - Doesn't check if credentials actually exist
- ✅ **Assumes correctness** - Treats all input as valid data

### 3. Sequential Processing

- ✅ **Source → Transform → Destination** - Always in this order
- ✅ **Complete one node at a time** - Never asks questions for multiple nodes simultaneously
- ✅ **Move to next only when complete** - All fields must be provided before progression

### 4. State Persistence

- ✅ **Maintains workflow state** - Preserves configuration across messages
- ✅ **Updates incrementally** - Only changes fields that are being updated
- ✅ **Preserves existing data** - Never recreates nodes from scratch

### 5. Conversation Flow

- ✅ **One question at a time** - Never asks multiple questions simultaneously
- ✅ **Clear examples** - Every question includes "For example:" guidance
- ✅ **Thank user** - Acknowledges each piece of information provided
- ✅ **Track progress** - Updates node status based on provided information

## Technical Implementation

### AI Service (`aiService.ts`)

- **Groq Cloud integration** with automatic model fallback
- **JSON response parsing** with error recovery and retry logic
- **Conversation history management** with file-based persistence
- **Workflow state tracking** with node configuration updates

### WebSocket Handler (`websocket.ts`)

- **Real-time communication** with frontend
- **Message routing** between client and AI service
- **Thought broadcasting** for user feedback during processing
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation

### Server Configuration

- **Environment variables** for API keys and configuration
- **CORS handling** for cross-origin requests
- **Security middleware** for request validation
- **Graceful shutdown** handling

## 🔌 API Endpoints

### WebSocket Communication

**Connection**: `wss://ai-workflow-interface-production.up.railway.app`

**Message Types**:
- **MESSAGE**: User messages and AI responses with workflow data
- **STATUS**: Processing status updates (`processing`, `complete`, `error`)
- **ERROR**: Error responses with detailed messages
- **GET_NODE_DATA**: Request specific node configuration
- **NODE_DATA**: Node configuration data response

**Example Message Flow**:
```javascript
// Client sends
{
  "id": "msg_123",
  "role": "user",
  "type": "MESSAGE",
  "content": "Connect Shopify to Snowflake",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}

// Server responds
{
  "id": "msg_124",
  "role": "assistant",
  "type": "MESSAGE",
  "content": "I'll help you connect Shopify to Snowflake...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:01.000Z",
  "nodes": [...],
  "connections": [...],
  "workflow_complete": false
}
```

### REST Endpoints

- **Health Check** (`GET /health`): Server status and uptime
- **AI Routes** (`/api/ai/*`): AI conversation endpoints

## Environment Variables

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...          # Required: Groq Cloud API key
PORT=3001                     # Optional: Server port (default: 3001)
NODE_ENV=production          # Optional: Environment mode
```

## Error Handling

### AI Service Errors

- **API key validation** on startup
- **Model fallback** when primary model fails
- **JSON parsing recovery** with retry logic
- **Graceful degradation** when AI service is unavailable

### Conversation Errors

- **File system fallback** to in-memory storage
- **Conversation clearing** on startup for clean state
- **Error messages** returned to client for user feedback

## Deployment

### Railway Deployment

- **Automatic deployment** on push to main branch
- **Environment variable configuration** through Railway dashboard
- **Health check monitoring** for service availability

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Development with hot reload
npm start           # Production mode
```

## Monitoring and Logging

- **Console logging** for debugging and monitoring
- **Error tracking** with detailed error messages
- **Performance monitoring** for AI response times
- **Conversation tracking** for debugging user flows

## Security Considerations

- **No input validation** - Accepts all user input as-is
- **No credential verification** - Doesn't test provided credentials
- **Environment variable protection** - API keys stored securely
- **CORS configuration** - Controlled cross-origin access

## Performance Characteristics

- **AI response time**: 1-10 seconds depending on model
- **WebSocket latency**: Near real-time communication
- **Memory usage**: Minimal for conversation storage
- **Scalability**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling

This server is designed to be **predictable, consistent, and user-friendly** while maintaining a rigid structure that ensures all workflows follow the same configuration pattern.

### 2. Deploy from GitHub

1. Click "New Project"
2. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Choose your `ai-workflow-interface` repository
4. Railway will use the `railway.json` configuration to build the server

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, go to your project â†’ Variables tab and add:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
```

### 4. Deploy

- Railway will automatically build and deploy
- Your server will be available at: `https://your-project-name.railway.app`
